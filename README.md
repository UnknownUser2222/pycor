# FAQ (most asked)
## 1. What is PyCor?
Check #about-pycor (or at the very top) for info.
## 2. How do I use PyCor?
Type help_pycor for help. IF that does not work, contact us.
## 3. Do I need to Install the PyCor API?
Well, no. You can link it, but you can't "install" it.
## 4. Do I have enough space and specs?
Yes really, because you need Windows 95 and very low specs.
## 5. Will PyCor get malware to my PC?
Absolutely NO. No malware, spyware, viruses, trojans, adware is available in our command line unless a PUP enters `redirect` and with the link, so still be careful on the internet!
