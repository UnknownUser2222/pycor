# FAQ (most asked)

Check #about-pycor (or at the very top) for info.
## 2. How do I use PyCor?
Type help_pycor for help. IF that does not work, contact us.
## 3. Do I need to Install the PyCor API?
Well, no. You can link it, but you can't "install" it.
## 4. Do I have enough space and specs?
Yes really, because you need Windows 95 and very low specs.
## 5. Will PyCor get malware to my PC?
Absolutely NO. No malware, spyware, viruses, trojans, adware is available in our command line unless a PUP enters `redirect` and with the link, so still be careful on the internet!

## Updating

You should update your system to a newer version (e.g. 1.01.0 from 1.00.0) every 1 month for security features and more.

To update first keep a entire backup of your previous version by finding the old directory of the program and copying it to somewhere else. It is recommended to name the
folder "PyCor Backup" and keep it in the "Documents" folder. Uninstall the old version (not the backup in case of an error or roll back) and download the new version.
After you have downloaded the file unzip/open the setup program and it will install the new version to the system. 

### Rolling back
If you want to roll back (error or bug), first uninstall the current version then drag the backup folder and put it in C:/Program Files (x86)/. After you have
relocated it, rename it to "PyCor", create a shortcut, and you have rolled back. That's for the EXE executable.

To do this for the ZIP programs, delete the newer ZIP file and replace with the old one.
